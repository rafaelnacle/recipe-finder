# Recipe Finder
This is a project I did to finish the javascript course from [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/tracks/backend). Every few sessions we are requested to do a personal project, and this is the project I decided to do. I was going to make a game dev insights project using d3.js but I've stumbled into a lot of problems finding a good game dev api.

So I decided to keep it a little simpler and make a recipe finder.
