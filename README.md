# Recipe Finder
This is a project I did to finish the javascript course from [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/tracks/backend). Every few sessions we are requested to do a personal project, and this is the project I decided to do. I was going to make a game dev insights project using d3.js but I've stumbled into a lot of problems finding a good game dev api.

So I decided to keep it a little simpler and make a recipe finder.

### How to start
**Clone the repository**
```bash
 git clone https://github.com/rafaelnacle/recipe-finder.git
```
**Install the dependencies**
```bash
  npm install
```
**Run the project**
I've used the native .env since you don't need to install dotenv anymore, I've did a script for easily running it. You'll still have to create a .env using your API-ID and KEY
```bash
  npm run dev
```
 

### What I've used
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [Fastify](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [Edaman API](https://www.edamam.com/)
